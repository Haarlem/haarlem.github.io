# IOTA Verifiable Claims Proof of Concept

Status: üë©‚Äçüî¨ Proof of Concept

This project is an example of how to use the [IOTA](iota.org) [tangle](https://learn.iota.org/faq/tangle) with [Discipl](https://discipl.org/) library to publish digital [verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/). These digital certificates replace the certificates the City of Haarlem has to print on expensive forge-proof paper. Thus increasing the speed and decreasing the cost of our digital service delivery.

There are many more possible applications for digital verifiable claims in public administrations. This [proof of concept](https://github.com/Haarlem/digitale-waardepapieren/blob/develop/docs/proof-of-concept.md) demonstrates where we can start.
However, once these verifiable claims are digital many others can also be digitised on the same infrastructure, dramatically lowering the barrier to using verifications.
