# Open Source public service delivery components and tools

We are developing – in collaboration with software vendors and other governments – Open Source components and tools to enable its digital transformation away from paper processes towards 100% digital processes.

We hold the opinion that governments should have control over their processes and they should not be dependent on third parties. We have control over, can take responsibility for and can stimulate innovation and improve public service delivery.

Haarlem has already developed an initial set of services and data components. We're sharing the source code to these components with the goal of improving them collaboratively. 

The Open Source software – made to be reused – can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/haarlem) along with the source code, documentation on implementing it and instructions to contribute to the ongoing development.

## Horizontal Layers Model: architecture as a platform

We've chosen to adhere to a strict five-layer architecture in our systems. This architecture makes open development easier and makes it easy to develop free from the silos of the organisation. We see this model, partly based on the [Common Ground](https://vng.nl/samen-organiseren/common-ground) principles, as a platform to build solutions on that we call the Horizontal Layers Model.

The Horizontal Layers Model consists architecture layers are

1. **Interaction**: Front-end applications, websites, apps
2. **Control**: Business Process Engines and Decision Engines, Domain-specific 'silo' applications
3. **Integration**: streams, proxies, connectors, adaptors
4. **Services**: Publication and mutation of data through APIs
5. **Data**: Databases, archives

All of [the components and tools we develop](projects/index.md) adhere to this architecture and combine easily into a platform. 

Since all components are compliant with standards – both [GEMMA standards as set by the Dutch Association of Municipalities](https://gemmaonline.nl) and existing Open Standards - organisations can iteratively move on to the platform by replacing components one by one.

## We're looking for collaborators and partners

We're looking for

* other cities and municipalities that we can help thinking and strategising about their digital transformation
* cities that are interested in adopting similar processes and architectures
* software developers that can serve as implementation, support or development partners for us and other municipalities

Please get in touch!
