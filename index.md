# Open Source public service delivery components and tools

We are developing – in collaboration with software vendors and other governments – Open Source components and tools to enable its digital transformation away from paper processes towards 100% digital processes.

We hold the opinion that governments should have control over their processes and they should not be dependent on third parties. We have control over, can take responsibility for and can stimulate innovation and improve public service delivery.

Haarlem has already developed an initial set of services and data components. We're sharing the source code to these components with the goal of improving them collaboratively.

Most of what we develop is developed in the [HLM architecture and platform](hlm/index.md).

The Open Source software – made to be reused – can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/haarlem) along with the source code, documentation on implementing it and instructions to contribute to the ongoing development.

## We're looking for collaborators and partners

We're looking for

* other cities and municipalities that we can help thinking and strategising about their digital transformation
* cities that are interested in adopting similar processes and architectures
* software developers that can serve as implementation, support or development partners for us and other municipalities

Please get in touch!
