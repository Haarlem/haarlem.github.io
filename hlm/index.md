# HLM Architecture and Platform

We've chosen to adhere to a strict five-layer architecture in our systems. This architecture makes open development easier and makes it easy to develop free from the silos of the organisation. We see this model, partly based on the [Common Ground](https://vng.nl/samen-organiseren/common-ground) principles, as a platform to build solutions on that we call the Horizontal Layers Model.

## Layers

The Horizontal Layers Model consists architecture layers are:

{% include layers.html select = '1 2 3 4 5'%}

All of the components and tools we develop adhere to this architecture and combine easily into a platform.

Since all components are compliant with standards â€“ both [GEMMA standards as set by the Dutch Association of Municipalities](https://gemmaonline.nl) and existing Open Standards - organisations can iteratively move on to the platform by replacing components one by one.
